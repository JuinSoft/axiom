# Getting Started with Axiom

Welcome to Axiom, the no-code platform for creating, deploying, and managing AI agents on the Injective blockchain. This guide will help you get started with the platform.

## What is Axiom?

Axiom is a platform that allows you to create AI agents without writing code. These agents can perform various tasks on the Injective blockchain, such as monitoring markets, executing trades, and analyzing data. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for designing agents, deploying them to the blockchain, and managing their lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using Axiom, you'll need:

1. **An Injective Wallet**: You'll need an Injective-compatible wallet to interact with the platform. We recommend using [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) with the Injective extension.

2. **INJ Tokens**: You'll need some INJ tokens to pay for gas fees when deploying agents to the blockchain. You can get testnet tokens from the [Injective Faucet](https://testnet.faucet.injective.network/).

## Creating an Account

To use Axiom, you'll need to create an account:

1. Visit the Axiom platform at [https://axiom.example.com](https://axiom.example.com)
2. Click on the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your wallet provider (Keplr or Metamask)
4. Follow the prompts to connect your wallet
5. Once connected, your wallet address will be used as your Axiom account

## Platform Overview

The Axiom platform consists of several key sections:

### Design Studio

The Design Studio is where you create and configure your AI agents. You can:

- Define agent behaviors using natural language
- Configure agent parameters
- Test agent functionality before deployment

### Deployment

The Deployment section allows you to deploy your agents to the Injective blockchain. You can:

- Select the network (mainnet, testnet, or devnet)
- Configure deployment parameters
- Monitor deployment status

### Dashboard

The Dashboard provides an overview of your deployed agents. You can:

- Monitor agent performance
- View agent activity
- Manage agent lifecycle

### Marketplace

The Marketplace allows you to buy, sell, and share agent designs. You can:

- Browse available agents
- Purchase agents created by others
- List your own agents for sale
