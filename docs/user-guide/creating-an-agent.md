# Creating an AI Agent

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an AI agent using the Axiom platform's Design Studio.

## Accessing the Design Studio

1. Log in to your Axiom account
2. Navigate to the "Design Studio" section from the main navigation menu
3. Click on the "New Agent" button to start creating a new agent

## Defining Your Agent

### Step 1: Basic Information

Start by providing basic information about your agent:

1. **Name**: Give your agent a descriptive name
2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of what your agent does
3. **Category**: Select a category that best describes your agent's purpose (e.g., Trading, Analytics, Monitoring)
4. **Visibility**: Choose whether your agent will be private or available on the marketplace

### Step 2: Agent Capabilities

Define what your agent can do:

1. Click on the "Add Capability" button
2. Select from the available capability templates or create a custom one:
   - **Market Monitoring**: Monitor specific markets or trading pairs
   - **Trading**: Execute trades based on conditions
   - **Data Analysis**: Analyze on-chain or off-chain data
   - **Notification**: Send alerts based on specific triggers
   - **Custom**: Define a custom capability using natural language

3. For each capability, configure the specific parameters:
   - For Market Monitoring: Select markets, timeframes, and indicators
   - For Trading: Define entry/exit conditions, position sizing, and risk management
   - For Data Analysis: Select data sources and analysis methods
   - For Notification: Configure triggers and notification channels

### Step 3: Agent Logic

Define the logic that governs your agent's behavior:

1. Use the visual flow builder to create decision trees and workflows
2. Connect different capabilities using conditional logic
3. Define triggers that activate specific actions
4. Set up loops for recurring tasks

Example logic flow:
- **IF** BTC/USD price drops by 5% within 1 hour
- **THEN** Check RSI indicator
- **IF** RSI < 30
- **THEN** Execute buy order
- **ELSE** Send notification to user

### Step 4: AI Configuration

Configure the AI components of your agent:

1. Select the AI models to use (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, custom models)
2. Define the prompts and instructions for the AI
3. Configure how the AI should interpret data and make decisions
4. Set up feedback mechanisms for continuous learning

## Testing Your Agent

Before deploying your agent, you should test it thoroughly:

1. Click on the "Test" button in the Design Studio
2. The platform will run your agent in a simulated environment
3. Review the agent's behavior and outputs
4. Make adjustments as needed

### Simulation Options

You can test your agent under different conditions:

1. **Historical Simulation**: Test how your agent would have performed in the past
2. **Real-time Simulation**: Test your agent with current market data but without executing real transactions
3. **Custom Scenarios**: Create specific scenarios to test edge cases

## Saving and Versioning

1. Click on the "Save" button to save your agent design
2. Add version notes to track changes
3. You can create multiple versions of your agent to compare different configurations

## Next Steps

Once you've created and tested your agent, you're ready to:

- [Share your agent](using-the-marketplace.md) on the Axiom marketplace
- [Monitor your agent](monitoring-agents.md) using the Dashboard
