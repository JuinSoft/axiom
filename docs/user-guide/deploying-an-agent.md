# Deploying an AI Agent

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your AI agent to the Injective blockchain using the Axiom platform.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your agent, ensure you have:

1. Created and tested your agent in the [Design Studio](creating-an-agent.md)
2. Connected your Injective wallet to the Axiom platform
3. Sufficient INJ tokens in your wallet to cover deployment and operational costs

## Accessing the Deployment Section

1. Log in to your Axiom account
2. Navigate to the "Deployment" section from the main navigation menu
3. Select the agent you want to deploy from your saved agents

## Deployment Configuration

### Step 1: Network Selection

Choose the network where you want to deploy your agent:

1. **Testnet**: For testing purposes (recommended for first-time deployments)
2. **Mainnet**: For production use
3. **Devnet**: For development and advanced testing

### Step 2: Resource Allocation

Configure the resources for your agent:

1. **Compute Resources**: Select the computational resources your agent will use
   - Basic: Suitable for simple agents with minimal processing needs
   - Standard: Balanced resources for most agents
   - Advanced: High-performance resources for complex agents

2. **Storage**: Select the amount of storage your agent will need
   - This affects how much data your agent can store and process

3. **Execution Frequency**: Define how often your agent will run
   - Continuous: Agent runs continuously
   - Scheduled: Agent runs at specified intervals
   - Event-triggered: Agent runs when specific events occur

### Step 3: Cost Estimation

Review the estimated costs for deploying and running your agent:

1. **Deployment Cost**: One-time cost to deploy the agent to the blockchain
2. **Operational Cost**: Recurring cost to keep the agent running
3. **Transaction Costs**: Estimated costs for transactions your agent will execute

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Review and Confirm

1. Review all deployment settings
2. Confirm that you want to proceed with the deployment

### Step 2: Wallet Authorization

1. Your connected wallet will prompt you to authorize the deployment transaction
2. Review the transaction details in your wallet
3. Confirm the transaction

### Step 3: Deployment Monitoring

1. The platform will show the deployment progress
2. You'll see status updates as your agent is deployed to the blockchain
3. Once deployment is complete, you'll receive a confirmation message

## Post-Deployment Configuration

After your agent is deployed, you may need to configure additional settings:

### API Keys and Integrations

If your agent uses external APIs or services:

1. Navigate to the "Integrations" tab in the agent settings
2. Add and configure the necessary API keys and credentials
3. Test the integrations to ensure they're working properly

### Notifications and Alerts

Configure how you'll be notified about your agent's activities:

1. Navigate to the "Notifications" tab in the agent settings
2. Set up notification channels (email, Telegram, Discord, etc.)
3. Configure alert conditions (e.g., successful trades, errors, specific events)

## Managing Deployed Agents

Once your agent is deployed, you can manage it from the Dashboard:

1. **Start/Stop**: Pause or resume your agent's operations
2. **Update**: Deploy new versions of your agent
3. **Monitor**: Track your agent's performance and activities
4. **Decommission**: Remove your agent from the blockchain when no longer needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Insufficient Funds**: Ensure you have enough INJ tokens in your wallet
2. **Failed Transactions**: Check the transaction details in your wallet or block explorer
3. **Configuration Errors**: Review your agent's configuration for any issues
4. **Network Issues**: Verify that the selected network is operational

## Next Steps

After successfully deploying your agent, you can:

- [Monitor your agent](monitoring-agents.md) using the Dashboard
- [Share your agent](using-the-marketplace.md) on the Axiom marketplace
- [Create additional agents](creating-an-agent.md) to expand your portfolio
