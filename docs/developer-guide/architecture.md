# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the Axiom platform architecture, explaining how different components interact to enable the design, deployment, and management of AI agents.

## System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](../../frontend/src/assets/arch.svg)

The Axiom platform consists of several key components:

1. **Frontend Application**: A React-based web interface for users to design, deploy, and manage agents
2. **Backend Server**: Node.js server that handles API requests, AI processing, and blockchain interactions
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Connection to the Injective blockchain for deploying and managing agents
4. **iAgent Framework**: Python-based AI agent framework developed by Injective Labs
5. **Smart Contracts**: CosmWasm contracts for the agent marketplace

## Component Interactions

### User Interface Flow

1. **Design Phase**: Users design agents using the drag-and-drop interface or natural language inputs
2. **Configuration**: Agent configurations are generated with AI assistance
3. **Deployment**: Agents are deployed to the Injective blockchain via iAgent
4. **Monitoring**: Users can monitor and manage their deployed agents
5. **Marketplace**: Users can share, buy, or sell agent designs

### Technical Flow

1. **Frontend → Backend**: API requests for agent design, configuration, and deployment
2. **Backend → iAgent**: Requests to generate agent configurations and deploy agents
3. **Backend → Blockchain**: Interactions with the Injective blockchain for transactions
4. **Smart Contracts → Blockchain**: Agent marketplace contracts for buying and selling agents

## Data Flow

### Agent Creation

```
User → Frontend → Backend → AI Service → Backend → Frontend → User
```

### Agent Deployment

```
User → Frontend → Backend → iAgent → Injective Blockchain → Backend → Frontend → User
```

### Marketplace Transactions

```
User → Frontend → Backend → Smart Contracts → Injective Blockchain → Backend → Frontend → User
```

## Deployment Architecture

The Axiom platform can be deployed in various environments:

1. **Development**: Local deployment for development and testing
2. **Staging**: Deployment for integration testing
3. **Production**: Deployment for end-users

### Deployment Components

- **Frontend**: Deployed as a static website
- **Backend**: Deployed as a Node.js application
- **iAgent**: Deployed as a Python service
- **Smart Contracts**: Deployed to the Injective blockchain

## Security Architecture

The Axiom platform incorporates several security measures:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and wallet-based authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Blockchain Security**: Secure smart contract interactions

## Scalability

The Axiom platform is designed to be scalable:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple instances of the backend server
2. **Database Sharding**: For handling large amounts of data
3. **Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribution of requests across multiple servers

## Future Architecture Enhancements

1. **Microservices**: Decomposition of the backend into microservices
2. **Serverless Functions**: For specific functionality
3. **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Integration with advanced AI models
4. **Cross-Chain Support**: Integration with additional blockchains
